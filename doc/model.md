The currents and voltage drops throughout the circuit are determined based on the voltage supplies and resistances.
Kirkhoff's laws are applied using the Modified Nodal Analysis strategy.  Please see

Wires and batteries are constrained to have nonzero resistance to avoid numerical errors or unsolvable circuits.  Loops cannot
be built without wires, hence this constraint guarantees that each loop will have at least some resistance and be
solvable.

Batteries can be ideal (no resistance) or have an internal resistance (in the 2nd screen of Circuit Construction Kit: DC).

Resistors such as the dollar bill, eraser and dog have a resistance of 10^9 Ohms.

The ammeters and voltmeter are ideal (no resistance).
